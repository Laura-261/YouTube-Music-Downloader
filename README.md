## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"
- Check if the server is running (`python server.py`).
- Ensure port 5000 is not in use.

### "Download error"
- Check your internet connection.
- Some videos may have geographic restrictions.
- Update yt-dlp: `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`

### Login Errors (403/500)
- Ensure your computer's clock is synced (Google Auth requires precise time).
- Verify `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` matches your console project.
- Check server logs for database permissions (`data/` folder must be writable).
